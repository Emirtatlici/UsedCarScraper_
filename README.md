In this project I have developed a module which extracts used car data through API Endpoints of cars.usnews.com.

Some information about module:

- With the help of the module you can extract data from the website & save the extracted data to excel file.

- You can retrieve data on used cars within specified years, prices, and mileage ranges.

- Module saves the extracted data even if your connection is aborted.

- You can feel free to stop scraping by using "CTRL+C", after you stopped the scraping process, the data you scraped will be saved to your folder. (Unfortunately, it does not work in Jupyter Notebooks.)
